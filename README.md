Some small projects I might want access to on multiple machines. Published under an open source license, mostly because I can't make the
repo private.

systemsolver.js is a linear system solver written in javascript. It interprets input in a reasonably forgiving manner, and currently
solves via simple Gaussian elimination. I want to eventually make it solve via LU decomposition into forward and backward substitution
where applicale, and possibly add support for factoring polynomials with no more than two non-rational roots.
